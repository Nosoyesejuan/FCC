                    <p>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.</p><br>
                    <p>The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python Web site, <a href="https://www.python.org/" class="main-section__link" target="_blank">https://www.python.org/</a>, and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.</p><br>
                    <p>The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.</p>

                    <p>If you do much work on computers, eventually you find that there’s some task you’d like to automate. For example, you may wish to perform a search-and-replace over a large number of text files, or rename and rearrange a bunch of photo files in a complicated way. Perhaps you’d like to write a small custom database, or a specialized GUI application, or a simple game.</p><br>
                    <p>If you’re a professional software developer, you may have to work with several C/C++/Java libraries but find the usual write/compile/test/re-compile cycle is too slow. Perhaps you’re writing a test suite for such a library and find writing the testing code a tedious task. Or maybe you’ve written a program that could use an extension language, and you don’t want to design and implement a whole new language for your application.</p><br>
                    <p>Python is just the language for you.</p><br>
                    <p>You could write a Unix shell script or Windows batch files for some of these tasks, but shell scripts are best at moving around files and changing text data, not well-suited for GUI applications or games. You could write a C/C++/Java program, but it can take a lot of development time to get even a first-draft program. Python is simpler to use, available on Windows, Mac OS X, and Unix operating systems, and will help you get the job done more quickly.</p><br>
                    <p>Python is simple to use, but it is a real programming language, offering much more structure and support for large programs than shell scripts or batch files can offer. On the other hand, Python also offers much more error checking than C, and, being a <i>very-high-level language</i>, it has high-level data types built in, such as flexible arrays and dictionaries. Because of its more general data types Python is applicable to a much larger problem domain than Awk or even Perl, yet many things are at least as easy in Python as in those languages.</p><br>
                    <p>Python is an interpreted language, which can save you considerable time during program development because no compilation and linking is necessary. The interpreter can be used interactively, which makes it easy to experiment with features of the language, to write throw-away programs, or to test functions during bottom-up program development. It is also a handy desk calculator.</p><br>
                    <p>Python enables programs to be written compactly and readably. Programs written in Python are typically much shorter than equivalent C, C++, or Java programs, for several reasons:</p><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement;</li>
                        <li>statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets;</li>
                        <li>no variable or argument declarations are necessary.</li>
                        <li>Python has built-in list and dictionary data structures which can be used to construct fast runtime data structures.</li>
                        <li>Python offers excellent readability and uncluttered simple-to-learn syntax which helps beginners to utilize this programming language.</li>

                <header>Using the Python Interpreter</header>
                <article>
                    <p>The Python interpreter is usually installed as <code>/usr/local/bin/python3.9</code> on those machines where it is available; putting <code>/usr/local/bin</code> in your Unix shell’s search path makes it possible to start it by typing the command:</p><br>
                    <code class="block-code">python3.9</code><br>
                    <p>Since the choice of the directory where the interpreter lives is an installation option, other places are possible; check with your local Python guru or system administrator. (E.g., <code>/usr/local/python</code> is a popular alternative location.)</p><br>
                    <p>On Windows machines where you have installed Python from the Microsoft Store, the <code>python3.9</code> command will be available. If you have the py.exe launcher installed, you can use the <code>py</code> command.</p><br>
                    <p>Typing an end-of-file character (<code>Control-D</code> on Unix, <code>Control-Z</code> on Windows) at the primary prompt causes the interpreter to exit with a zero exit status. If that doesn’t work, you can exit the interpreter by typing the following command: <code>quit()</code>.</p><br>
                    <p>The interpreter’s line-editing features include interactive editing, history substitution and code completion on systems that support the GNU Readline library. Perhaps the quickest check to see whether command line editing is supported is typing <code>Control-P</code> to the first Python prompt you get. If it beeps, you have command line editing; see Appendix Interactive Input Editing and History Substitution for an introduction to the keys. If nothing appears to happen, or if <code>^P</code> is echoed, command line editing isn’t available; you’ll only be able to use backspace to remove characters from the current line.</p><br>
                    <p>The interpreter operates somewhat like the Unix shell: when called with standard input connected to a tty device, it reads and executes commands interactively; when called with a file name argument or with a file as standard input, it reads and executes a <i>script</i> from that file.</p><br>

                <header>An Informal Introduction to Python</header>
                <article>
                    <p>In the following examples, input and output are distinguished by the presence or absence of prompts (>>> and …): to repeat the example, you must type everything after the prompt, when the prompt appears; lines that do not begin with a prompt are output from the interpreter. Note that a secondary prompt on a line by itself in an example means you must type a blank line; this is used to end a multi-line command.</p><br>
                    <p>Many of the examples in this manual, even those entered at the interactive prompt, include comments. Comments in Python start with the hash character, <code>#</code>, and extend to the end of the physical line. A comment may appear at the start of a line or following whitespace or code, but not within a string literal. A hash character within a string literal is just a hash character. Since comments are to clarify code and are not interpreted by Python, they may be omitted when typing in examples.</p><br>
                    <p>Some examples:</p><br>
                    <code class="block-code"># this is the first comment<br>
                    spam = 1  # and this is the second comment<br>
                              # ... and now a third!<br>
                    text = "# This is not a comment because it's inside quotes."</code>

                <header>More Control Flow Tools</header>
                <article>
                    <p>Besides the <code>while</code> statement just introduced, Python uses the usual flow control statements known from other languages, with some twists.</p><br>
                    <h3><code>if</code> Statements</h3>
                    <p>Perhaps the most well-known statement type is the <code>if</code> statement. For example:</p><br>
                    <code class="block-code">>>> x = int(input("Please enter an integer: "))
                    Please enter an integer: 42
                    >>> if x < 0:
                    ...     x = 0
                    ...     print('Negative changed to zero')
                    ... elif x == 0:
                    ...     print('Zero')
                    ... elif x == 1:
                    ...     print('Single')
                    ... else:
                    ...     print('More')
                    ...
                    More</code><br>
                    <p>There can be zero or more <code>elif</code> parts, and the <code>else</code> part is optional. The keyword <code>‘elif’</code> is short for ‘else if’, and is useful to avoid excessive indentation. An <code>if … elif … elif …</code> sequence is a substitute for the <code>switch</code> or <code>case</code> statements found in other languages.</p><br>
                    <h3><code>for</code> Statements</h3>
                    <p>The <code>for</code> statement in Python differs a bit from what you may be used to in C or Pascal. Rather than always iterating over an arithmetic progression of numbers (like in Pascal), or giving the user the ability to define both the iteration step and halting condition (as C), Python’s <code>for</code> statement iterates over the items of any sequence (a list or a string), in the order that they appear in the sequence. For example (no pun intended):</p><br>
                    <code class="block-code">>>> # Measure some strings:
                    ... words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']
                    >>> for w in words:
                    ...     print(w, len(w))
                    ...
                    cat 3
                    window 6
                    defenestrate 12</code><br>
                    <p>Code that modifies a collection while iterating over that same collection can be tricky to get right. Instead, it is usually more straight-forward to loop over a copy of the collection or to create a new collection:</p><br>
                    <code class="block-code"># Strategy:  Iterate over a copy
                    for user, status in users.copy().items():
                        if status == 'inactive':
                            del users[user]
                    
                    # Strategy:  Create a new collection
                    active_users = {}
                    for user, status in users.items():
                        if status == 'active':
                            active_users[user] = status</code><br>
                </article>

            <section class="main-section" id="data_structures">
                <header>Data Structures</header>
                <article>
                    <p>This chapter describes some things you’ve learned about already in more detail, and adds some new things as well.</p><br>
                    <h3>More on Lists</h3>
                    <p>The list data type has some more methods. Here are all of the methods of list objects:</p><br>
                    <h4><code>list.</code> append(x)</h4>
                    <p>Add an item to the end of the list. Equivalent to <code>a[len(a):] = [x]</code>.</p><br>
                    <h4><code>list.</code> extend(iterable)</h4>
                    <p>Extend the list by appending all the items from the iterable. Equivalent to <code>a[len(a):] = iterable</code>.</p><br>
                    <h4><code>list.</code> insert(i,x)</h4>
                    <p>Insert an item at a given position. The first argument is the index of the element before which to insert, so <code>a.insert(0, x)</code> inserts at the front of the list, and <code>a.insert(len(a), x)</code> is equivalent to <code>a.append(x)</code>.</p>
